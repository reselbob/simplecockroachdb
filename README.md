# simplecockroachdb `[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]`

A project that demonstrates how to use [CockroachDB](cockroachlabs.com) with the [TypeOrm](https://typeorm.io/#/) to implement a multi-container cluster under Docker.

## Steps
**Step 1:**

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster-in-docker-linux.html) to set up a multi-container cluster using Docker.

**Step 2:**

`npm install`

**Step 3:**

`npm start`

You'll get output similar to the following

```text
